# FunLittleProjects
This is a repo for all the fun little code snippets I do and learn along the way.
This is NOT part of my portfolio.
In this repository, I aim to use little code snippets I write while learning to code and also make a GUI for them so my friends can use them too.
For example, I might make a BMI calculator or a random number generator with easy GUI. While this may sound too easy and somewhat idiotic to build pages for, I consider it part of my training to become a developer.
